* Main objectives
** DONE Really generate toplevel CMakeLists.txt
** DONE Add support for extending CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
** DONE Make dependency fetcher build its dep-trace correctly
** TODO Write output to log
** TODO Write log to log file
** TODO Handle external program return codes correctly
** DONE Run all configured build-instances
…not just the default native build using make.
** TODO Determine inclusion-order for toplevel CMakeLists.txt
* Secondary
** TODO Detect cyclic dependencies in toplevel CMakeLists.txt
** TODO Implement version dependency judgements
** TODO Allow output to both terminal and log
** TODO Add more sub-commands
*** TODO Run compilation instances from build-tree
- [ ] All
- [ ] One
- [ ] Some
** TODO Add options to override dependency versions
It would be best to be able to put the option more than once and for it to use
patterns. So --dep-version "PATTERN=VERSIONTHING", for example:

  mmh --dep-version "*=master" build

…to build a module with all dependency versions set to ‘master’.
** TODO Add YamlStack variant for configuration parsing
** TODO Add option to keep running when a build-instance fails
** TODO Add a way to define dependencies for third-party modules
** DONE With non-temporary build-roots, invert --preserve
** DONE Generate mmh script
Configure:
- Python path
- Data directory (`/usr/share/MakeMeHappy`)
- Config directory (`/etc/MakeMeHappy`)
** TODO Add Debian Packaging
** TODO Flesh out user manual
** TODO Data read from YAML files should be verified
If we don't, we need to check tons of conditions at the points the data is
actually used. Checking data upfront allows us to write much more straight
forward code.
** TODO Allow the user to specify a subset of all defined build instances
If the module.yaml file defines 40 or 50 possible combinations of toolchains,
build configurations, tools and the like, it would be useful to pick from
those. Lists or patterns or both, I'm not sure yet.
* Wishlist
** DONE Forget "tools" — check all dependencies into "deps"
** TODO Zsh completion would be nice
** TODO Gather statistics while running
*** TODO How many dependency versions had a patch-level mismatch?
*** TODO How many dependency versions had a minor mismatch?
*** TODO How many dependency versions had a major mismatch?
*** TODO How many build-instances succeeded/failed?
*** TODO How many build-instances had their test runs succeed/fail?
*** TODO How much time did individual steps take to execute?
