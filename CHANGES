 User-visible changes in make-me-happy
=======================================

* v0.1 → v0.2 (released 2019-06-26):

** New Features:

- Execution statistics are gathered and summarised upon program termination
  (61a0483).

- Exit status now depends on the combined results of all build instances. Only
  if all instances succeed, does mmh return success (45c3f5b2).

- Tool definitions are now taken from configuration (however, modules can still
  override — a602f888).

- Handle output correctly; per default external programs don't push their
  output through logging facility. This can be forced, though. All output can
  also be dumped to file, in which case all output goes through the logging
  facility as well (63927123).
